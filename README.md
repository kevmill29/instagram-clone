# instagram-clone
This Instagram web app clone has been built using JavaScript. The code provided renders a feed of posts, and allows users to like and unlike posts. Here are some details on how to use and modify the code:

Getting Started
To use this code, you will need to do the following:

Clone the repository using git clone <repository-url>.
Install the dependencies using npm install.
Run the app using npm start.
Code Overview
The code is divided into two main parts:

The handleLikeClick function that handles the like and unlike feature of the app.
The getHtmlFeed function that returns the HTML for the feed of posts.
The handleLikeClick function
This function handles the like and unlike feature of the app. When a user clicks on the heart icon, the function is triggered. It then finds the post object that matches the clicked post and updates its like count. It also changes the heart icon to a solid or regular heart, depending on whether the post has been liked or not.

There are several ways to implement this feature, and the current implementation is just one approach. Here are some other ways to handle the like and unlike feature:

Using a database to store the posts and their like counts.
Using a state management library like Redux to manage the state of the app.
The getHtmlFeed function
This function returns the HTML for the feed of posts. It loops through the posts array and generates HTML for each post. It also calls the imgSwap function to determine which heart icon to display.

There are several ways to generate HTML for a feed of posts, and the current implementation is just one approach. Here are some other ways to generate HTML for a feed of posts:

Using a templating engine like Handlebars to generate the HTML.
Using a UI library like React to generate the HTML.
Conclusion
This Instagram web app clone is just a starting point, and there are many ways to improve and extend its functionality. By understanding the code and its components, you can modify it to suit your needs and build upon it to create a fully functional Instagram clone.
